Quantitative Research Project I created for JPMorgan & Chase Job Simulation through Forage. 
What I do:
- Completed a simulation focused on quantitative research methods 
- Analyzed a book of loans to estimate a customer's probability of default
- Used dynamic programming to convert FICO scores into categorical data to predict defaults
